## Introduction: Upgrading the Concurrency Capabilities of Scrapeless Scraping Browser
As the developers and founding team behind [Scrapeless](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapingbrowser), we are driven by a sincere passion for the future of AI automation. Our mission is to create an automated browser truly "designed for AI." Over the past few years, from Browserless.io to the numerous cloud vendors launching "Browser as a Service" (BaaS), the market has proven that AI Agents urgently need a new interaction medium—a cloud-based browser specifically designed for AI. For example, Auto-GPT can autonomously search for the best flights on Booking.com or automatically submit survey responses in Google Forms. Similarly, ChainGPT’s intelligent customer service system can log into e-commerce backends in real-time to retrieve order data and complete multi-step operations. Behind these capabilities lies an extreme pursuit of high concurrency and "human-like" simulation.

However, we have observed that existing solutions often stumble at two critical points:

**1. High-Concurrency Scaling:** When hundreds or thousands of proxy tasks simultaneously target a site, a single node quickly becomes a bottleneck.

**2. Realistic Browsing Behavior:** Multi-dimensional disguises such as fingerprint rotation, TLS characteristics, and mouse trajectories—if not precise enough—can be instantly flagged by the risk control systems of e-commerce platforms and social media.

With these challenges in mind, we focused on two key areas during the product design phase:
- **Cloud Elastic Scaling:** Scrapeless supports seamless scaling from tens to unlimited concurrent sessions, ensuring zero queuing and zero timeouts even during peak task loads.
  
- **Full-Stack Human-Like Protection:** By deeply customizing the Chromium kernel, Scrapeless achieves multi-dimensional fingerprint obfuscation, controllable TLS handshake strategies, and progressive mouse/keyboard simulations, making it nearly impossible for target websites to detect anomalies.
  
What makes this even more remarkable is that while delivering top-tier performance, we have reduced costs to 70% of industry-standard solutions, helping developers save 60%-80% on expenses for large-scale testing and long-running tasks. Whether you need to monitor thousands of SKUs through daily scraping or drive thousands of customer service bots across multiple sites, Scrapeless provides the most reliable and cost-effective infrastructure.

In the following sections, we will delve into the pricing advantages, core functionalities, and future roadmap of [Scrapeless Scraping Browser](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-browser?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapingbrowser), giving you a comprehensive understanding of why it is the ultimate choice for the "Browser for AI" era.

### 2. Price Comparison in Concurrent Scenarios
To more intuitively demonstrate Scrapeless's pricing advantage, we compare it through typical usage scenarios.

#### Case 1: Single Request (1 Browser Instance)
Assume a user initiates a single request (e.g., logging into ChatGPT), lasting 1 hour and consuming 1GB of traffic:

**Scrapeless (based on standard package rates):**
- Hourly rate: $0.072
- Proxy fee: $1.44
- Total cost = 0.072 + 1.44 = $1.512

**Competitor (using Brightdata as an example):**
- Hourly rate: $0.10
- Proxy fee: $9.5 (standard)
- Total cost = 0.10 + 9.5 = $9.6

**Cost Advantage: Scrapeless saves approximately 84.25% of the cost.**


---
#### Case 2: Large-Scale Concurrent Scenario (100 Browser Instances)
A user of Scrapeless is building an LLM-based marketing ranking monitoring system to scrape data from multiple websites in real-time and generate dynamic ranking reports. Their current business requirements demand running 100 browser instances simultaneously , lasting 1 hour , and consuming 40GB of traffic .

**Scrapeless (based on standard package rates):**
- Hourly rate: 0.072 × 100 = 7.2
- Proxy fee: 1.44 × 40 = 57.6
- Total cost = 7.2 + 57.6 = $64.8

**Competitor (using Zenrows as an example):**
- Hourly rate: 0.09 × 100 = 9
- Proxy fee: 2.8 × 40 = 112
- Total cost = 9 + 112 = $121

**Cost Advantage: Scrapeless saves approximately 46.45% of the cost.**

This user conducted a detailed price and performance comparison of mainstream browser automation tools during the project's early stages. They found that many competitors had the following issues when handling large-scale concurrent tasks:

- Insufficient high-concurrency support: Most tools have low maximum concurrency limits, unable to meet the requirement of 100 instances.The user’s future concurrency needs will exceed 500, and few products on the market can support this level of demand.
- High additional fees: Some products charge extra for high-concurrency tasks, causing overall costs to skyrocket.
- Limited technical support: When encountering CAPTCHA or anti-scraping mechanisms, some tools lack built-in solutions, increasing development complexity.

After a comprehensive evaluation, the user ultimately chose [Scrapeless Scraping Browser](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-browser?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapingbrowser). They stated that Scrapeless not only offers significant cost advantages (saving nearly 47% of the cost) but also ensures the efficiency and reliability of their data scraping system.
